# .bash_profile

### Bash Profile Settings

I forked this bash_profile from Nathaniel Landau https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/ and added a few additions

Additions:

Function:
  shachk() - Checks SHA1 in clipboard with file named
  appV()   - Gets kMDItemVersion of app named in path

Aliases:
  pyjss    - Calls python-jss / jss-helper. Requires [python-jss](https://github.com/jssimporter/python-jss) to be installed
  macModel - Gives hte model of the machine
  activeFont - Lists all active fonts
  cls / claer / clr - I've got fat fingers and can't type 'clear'!
