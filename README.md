# .bash_profile

### Bash Profile Settings

I forked this bash_profile from [Nathaniel Landau](https://natelandau.com/my-mac-osx-bash_profile/) and added a few additions

Since then I have cleared out ones that I do not use much, if at all, and added a few of my own. I also had a re-arrangement of certain aliases groupings to make it a bit more tidy

Some additions:

pyjss:  Added this for use with [JSS Python Helper](https://github.com/sheagcraig/jss_helper)
appV:   Displays the `kMDItemVersion` information

Some apps were installed and the defaults remapped to these after reading [Remy Sharps blog on his improved CLi](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved)

The following apps were installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

`brew install bat prettyping fzf glances diff-so-fancy fd nnn tldr ack ag jq`

cat -> bat    
ping -> prettyping    
du -> ncdu    
help -> tldr    
preview -> fzf    
top -> glances
